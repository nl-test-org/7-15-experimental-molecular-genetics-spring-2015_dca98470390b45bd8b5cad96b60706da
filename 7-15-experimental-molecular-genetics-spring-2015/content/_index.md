This project-based laboratory course provides students with in-depth experience in experimental molecular genetics, using modern methods of molecular biology and genetics to conduct original research. The course is geared towards students (including sophomores) who have a strong interest in a future career in biomedical research. This semester will focus on chemical genetics using _Caenorhabditis elegans_ as a model system. Students will gain experience in research rationale and methods, as well as training in the planning, execution, and communication of experimental biology.
